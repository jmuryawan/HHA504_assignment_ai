## 3 - Reflections on model accuracy and ease of use
GCP's speech-to-text output seems fairly accurate. I read a short passage from a news article that resulted in a 30 second recording. I made sure to fumble and mumble on a few wordsâ€“ the speech recognition model recognized that and input it in the results. It was also straightforward to use. All a user had to was give permission to Chrome to record audio, record an audio file through the API, and then submit it.
